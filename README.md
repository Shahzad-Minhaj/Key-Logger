## Keyboard Event Recorder

 This Python script uses the pynput library to record keyboard events. The program captures both key press and key release events, logging them to a file named log.txt. Additionally, the script includes a feature to stop recording when the 'esc' key is released.
## Prerequisites

 Before running the script, make sure to install the pynput library. You can install it using the following command:

 pip install pynput

 Usage

    Run the script.
    The script will start recording keyboard events.
    Press any keys to see the events logged in real-time in the log.txt file.
    To stop recording, release the 'esc' key.

## Log File Format

 The recorded events are saved in the log.txt file with the following format:

Key <key> pressed:<timestamp>

    <key> represents the specific key that was pressed.
    <timestamp> is the timestamp when the event occurred.
